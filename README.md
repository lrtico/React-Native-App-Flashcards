## A native flash card app (Android & iOS)
A flashcard app similar to Quizlet. Users can create 'decks' that contain questions and answers. The decks can then be used to practice quizzing oneself to move information from short-term memory into long-term memory.

Features listed below. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

This project was the final one in the React Nanodegree program through Udacity. For information, see (https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

Flashy was built for iOS devices and was tested on an iPhone X via the Xcode simulator and the Expo app on an iPhone 6+.

### Features
Users can do the following:
- Create decks
- Add questions and answers (cards) to decks
- Cycle through a deck's cards
- See how many questions they answered correctly at the end of a deck
- Restart a quiz
- Go back to the list of decks
- Opt in to receive local push notifications reminding them to take a quiz

### Requirements
I decided to use npm instead of yarn and due to bugginess, be sure to install npm 4 to avoid issues. To install npm4 enter:

```
npm install -g npm@4

```
For more information, see (https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/297).

The install steps below rely on Xcode being installed on your machine. To view the app in another device or simulator please refer to the documentation here (https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

This project uses Expo to assist with device simulation to learn more about device simulation options with Expo please refer to the documentation here (https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/index.html).

### Install steps
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lrtico/React-Native-App-Flashcards
